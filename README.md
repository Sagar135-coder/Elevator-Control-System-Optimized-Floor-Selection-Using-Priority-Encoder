# Elevator Control System Optimized Floor Selection Using Priority Encoder
## ***Problem Statement***
📌 SystemVerilog Lab - Project Guidelines 📌

1️⃣ Project Selection

Students must select one topic from either:

ADLD (2nd semester syllabus) OR

DSD (3rd semester syllabus). ALSO DONT FORGET TO INFORM THE FACULTY HANDLING THE SV LAB ABOUT SELECTED TOPIC

Example topics: Adders, Multiplexers, Flip-flops, Counters, boolean function implementation using  mux, decoder etc.

2️⃣ Implementation Requirements
For the selected topic, implement three versions:

Gate-level implementation using ONLY NOR gates

Behavioral implementation using standard Verilog constructs

Dataflow implementation using ONLY NAND gates

3️⃣ OOP-Based Testbench Requirements

🔹 For Gate-level Design:

Self-checking testbench using for loops

Must include:

✅ Package

✅ Interface

✅ Inheritance

✅ Virtual functions

Automatically verify outputs vs. expected results

🔹 For Behavioral Design:

Testbench using tasks for test scenarios

Must include:

✅ Package

✅ Interface

✅ Inheritance

✅ Virtual functions

Each major test case = separate task

🔹 For Dataflow Design:

Individual input generation + output comparison

Must include:

✅ Package

✅ Interface

✅ Inheritance

✅ Virtual functions

Compare each output with main design’s output

4️⃣ Code Quality Requirements

Well-commented code explaining:

Module purpose

Input/output descriptions

Key implementation details

Testbench methodology

Proper indentation & consistent naming conventions

5️⃣ Submission Requirements
For each design (gate-level, behavioral, dataflow):

📄 Main design file

📄 OOP-based testbench file

📸 Simulation output screenshots

📸 Tcl console output screenshots

📝 Brief report covering(Template will be shared):

Design choices

Testbench methodology

Results analysis
